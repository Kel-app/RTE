# Kel RTE

## Getting Started

This is the NPM package for Kel's rich text editor (RTE).

There isn't much involved setup, just install the package and import it into your project.

```bash
npm install @kel-app/rte
```

```tsx
import { RTE } from "@kel-app/rte";

const App = () => {
  return <RTE />;
};
```

## Contributing

Contributions are not being accepted at the moment, due to the lack of an official version of the package.
